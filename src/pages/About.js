      <p>My name is Brock. I am a full-stack software engineer, focused on innovative front-end development. I enjoy writing code that looks as good as it functions. Transitioning from a career in the ever-evolving airline industry, I’m able to adapt and learn quickly in new situations and rely on great communication to accomplish goals in a team.</p>
      <br/> 
      <p>I recently moved from Minneapolis, MN to Seattle, WA with my husband and dog, Gus. When I’m not behind my computer, I enjoy collecting and playing retro video games, trekking around the globe, skateboarding with my dog, and getting deep in coverations about music. I frequently use outdated slang like “rad” and “boss.” Let's grab a cold press and chat.
